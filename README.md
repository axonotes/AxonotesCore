## üéØ About Axonotes

Axonotes is envisioned as the ultimate command center for students and educators, designed to end the chaos of juggling
multiple applications. Our goal is to create a single, streamlined platform where notes, collaboration, planning,
learning tools (like flashcards and interactive exercises), and communication live together seamlessly.

We're building an all-in-one academic suite focused on:

- **Unified Workflow:** Notes, tasks, chat, and learning tools in one place.
- **Effortless Collaboration:** Real-time co-authoring with features like line-level locking.
- **Powerful Knowledge Creation:** Flexible note-taking (Markdown, rich text, infinite canvases, pen support), `LaTeX`
  support, and more.
- **Smart Organization:** Integrated planning, powerful global search, and knowledge graphs.
- **Offline-First & Cross-Platform:** Work anywhere, anytime, on any device.
- **Revolutionary Version History:** Every change saved, powered by SpaceTimeDB.
- **Secure & Private by Design:** Built with Swiss precision.

## üì¶ What's Inside This Monorepo?

This `AxonotesCore` repository is a monorepo that houses the foundational code for Axonotes:

- **`/app`**:

    - The Axonotes desktop application.
    - Built with **[Tauri](https://tauri.app/)** (using **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)** for the frontend).
    - Provides the cross-platform user interface (Windows, macOS, Linux) and client-side logic.
    - Handles offline-first capabilities and synchronization with the backend.

- **`/server`**:
    - The backend logic and data modules running on **[SpaceTimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com/)**.
    - Written in **Rust**.
    - Manages real-time collaboration, data persistence, and the detailed version history system.

> **Note:** Directory names are placeholders and may evolve.

## ‚è≥ Current Stage

Axonotes and this `AxonotesCore` repository are currently in the **early planning and development phase**. The code here
represents foundational work and is subject to significant changes as we iterate and refine our vision based on
community feedback.

## üöÄ Getting Started

As we are in the early stages, detailed setup and contribution guidelines for developers are still being formulated.

However, to work with this repository, you will generally need:

- **Rust Toolchain:** For the SpaceTimeDB modules.
- **Node.js & bun:** For the SvelteKit frontend and Tauri.
- **Tauri Prerequisites:** Follow the [Tauri setup guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) for
  your operating system.

More specific instructions for building, running, and developing will be added to the respective subdirectories (`/app`,
`/server`) as they mature.
